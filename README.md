Login authentication, in the most simple words, is the way of confirming the identity of a user while they access their profile on a particular platform. Admit it; we all have been using passwords for years to prove our identity on various platforms to access specific resources or information.


Using HTTP Basic Authentication

A client requests access to a protected resource. The Web server returns a dialog box that requests the user name and password. The client submits the user name and password to the server. The server validates the credentials and, if successful, returns the requested resource.
